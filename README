4_1
I matched the brightness level of the chars to the brightness level of the sub-image
by running for each part of the image, on the list of the brightnesses of the chars
and then found the char that was the closest to the brightness of the image, by using
the Math methode - Abs.


4_2
I used collection of type HashMap and also Set - Set to keep the chars set and prevent duplications
and the hashMap to save for later brightness level of images that might be used in the future and by
that to save complexity time.
